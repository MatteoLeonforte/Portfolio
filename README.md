# Portfolio

This repository contains some of the things I worked on. It is meant to give a quick look to my knowledge and programming skills.
Here a quick recup.

## Machine Learning
- Linear and Kernel Regression
- NN for embedding extraction
- NN for prediction and classification
- Autoencoders

## State Estimation
- Extended Kalman Filter
- Particle Filter

## Programming Languages:
- Python - very good [pytorch, torchvision, cProfiler]
- Matlab - very good
- C - good
- Java - good
